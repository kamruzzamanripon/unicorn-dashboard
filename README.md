### That's a short brief about this app. I hope you are enjoying it.

## 🍎 Explanation of your application structure and design choices.

### 📁 Directory Structure

Below is the directory structure of the project with explanations for each folder and its responsibilities:
![This is a alt text.](/public/screenshort/Screenshot_12.jpg)

### 🧐 Design Choices

The structure reflects the following principles:

1. Modularity:
   - UI components are broken down into logical subdirectories (common, dashboard, etc.) to keep the codebase clean and maintainable.
   - The modal and layout folders encapsulate reusable structures for UI consistency.
2. Separation of Concerns:
   - Page-level components (in views/) handle route-level logic and layout, while reusable components (in components/) focus on UI elements.
3. Routing Management:

   - All routing logic is centralized in the router/ directory to make navigation easier to maintain.

4. State Management:
   - The stores/ directory handles global state, ensuring components remain stateless and testable.

### 💪 challenges

    - Pagination Mechanism. In every request, I didn't know how many pages I got and there is no meta data about pagination.
    - Search feature add without call again api. Its do search inside data stored in pinia.

### 🌱 Bonus

    - Pinia store add.
    - Search feature add.
    - When delete item then show alert.
    - when create or update any item then show success message.
